.SH DESCRIPTION
Veco combines several scalar images by a pixelwise operation
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-g\fR GOODNESS
use a specific GOODNESS criterion for discarding samples
.SS "Operations:"
.TP
min
minimum value of the good samples
.TP
max

.TP
avg
average of the good samples
.TP
sum
sum of the good samples
.TP
med
medoid of the good samples (the central sample, rounding down)
.TP
medv
median of the good samples (average of 1 or 2 central samples)
.TP
mod
mode of the good samples (the value that appears more times)
.TP
cnt

.TP
mul,prod
product of all good samples
.TP
first

.SS "Goodness criteria:"
.TP
numeric
whether the sample is not NAN, this is the default
.TP
finite
whether the sample is a finite number
.TP
always
consider all samples regardless of their value
.TP
nonzero
whether the sample is numeric and not 0 or \fB\-0\fR
