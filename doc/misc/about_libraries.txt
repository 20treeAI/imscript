ABOUT LIBRARIES
===============

Software libraries are diseases.  You want to avoid them as much as possible.
Making your program depend on a library is like infecting it on purpose with
a well-known malady; while there may be legitimate reasons for that
infection, they need to be thoroughly justified.

Not all diseases are equivalent, and the same holds true for software
libraries.  The worse libraries are like cancer: you start depending on them
for a minor, non-essential part of your program (what could be the harm?) and
before you notice they have infected your whole program and there's no way to
remove them.  Other libraries are like the seasonal flu: you cannot avoid
"catching" them (for they provide a required feature), but after some time
you can remove them easily, leaving your program healthier, stronger, and
having gained resistance to further attempts at injecting dependencies.

Thus, when designing a library for other people to use, the programmer should
take care that it is very easy to get rid of it.
