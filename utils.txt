This repository has too many programs.  There are a few important,
"core" programs intermingled with dozens of silly, irrelevant or very
specific utils.

This file gives a list of the relevant programs.


CORE: generic tools for image processing

	plambda:  apply an expression with images as variables
	blur:     positive parametric linear convolution
	downsa:   zoom out
	upsa:     zoom in
	ntiply:   replicate pixels
	crop:     extract a region of interest
	fft/iif:  fourier transform of an image, and its inverse
	dct:      cosine transform of an image (self-inverse)
	imprintf: print info and statistics of an image
	veco:     accumulate values over a list of gray images
	vecov:    accumulate values over a list of multispectral images
	imgerr:   compare two images with a single number
	deframe:  projective crop (defined by 4 points in the image)
	cdeint:   deinterlace a video frame
	iion:     copy (useful for converting format)

	distance: image of distances to a set of points
	ransac:   compute robust models from data points
	elap:     laplace equation with irregular boundary condition
	amle:     infinity-laplacian equation
	siftu:    various mini-utils for dealing with sift points
	srmatch:  successive multi-scale matching of sift keypoints


FLOW: utils for producing or transforming vector fields

	synflow:    generate a parametric synthetic vector field
	backflow:   warp an image by a vector field
	flowinv:    compute the inverse vector field
	flowdiv:    compute the divergence of a vector field
	flowgrad:   compute the gradient of a vector field
	flow_ms:    multi-scale optical flow
	lk,hs,tvl1: different flavors of optical flow


VIS: utils for data visualization

	viewflow:   color code for a vector field
	flowarrows: display a vector field using arrows
	ghisto:     gray-level histogram (to be piped to gnuplot)
	chisto:     color histograms
	pview:      plot points and lines given by ascii numbers


WANTED: not yet implemented/ported from qnm

	fderiv:    partial derivatives of various types and schemes
	morphoop:  elementary gray-level morphological operations
	ccfilt:    compute connected components of a binary image
	ccbound:   compute boundaries of connected components
	ccdist:    distance transform
	cctree:    compute upper/lower/shape tree of a given image
	ccreco:    reconstruct an image from its tree
