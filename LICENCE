Imscript is a loose collection of independent programs.  Apart from a few
exceptional files (see below), the collection is distributed under a dual
licence:

1) The AGPL version 3.0; found on file doc/agpl.txt
2) A commercial licence; please contact the authors for details

If you want to use or re-distribute imscript you can choose either licence.



The following files are copied verbatim (or with trivial changes) from their
original sources.  They are included for convenience and they are not essential
for imscript.  They are not distributed under the dual-licence agreement above,
but under their own licences specified inside each file.
